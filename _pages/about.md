Before that, I received my B.E. degree from **Hainan University (HNU)** in 2018 and my M.E. degree from the **Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)** in 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Max Q.-H. Meng](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~qhmeng/about.html). During my graduate studies, I worked as a [Robotics Student Fellow](https://center-for-robotics.ethz.ch/education/robotics-student-fellowship/2021-Robotics-Student-Fellows.html) at **ETH ZÃ¼rich (ETHZ)** in the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://asl.ethz.ch/), under the supervision of [Prof. Siegwart, Roland](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=MDIyLnwAAAAJ), [Prof. Chung, Jen Jen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FpzRM5UAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Dr. Dugas, Daniel](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=9v-eZhEAAAAJ&hl=en), in 2021. Additionally, I worked as a research assistant in the Robotics, Perception, and AI Lab at **the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)** and as a visiting student in the [Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Robotics, Perception, and Intelligence](http://robotics.lonwin.net/index.aspx) at **the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**. In 2022, I worked at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen Research Institute). From 2022 to Sep.2024, I was a research associate at the [Munich Institute of Robotics and Machine Intelligence (MIRMI)](https://www.mirmi.tum.de/en/mirmi/home/) of the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, under the supervision of [Prof. Sami Haddadin](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=H1v0ztEAAAAJ&hl=de) and [Prof. Luis Figueredo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ppZN58sAAAAJ&hl=en).
